# heart_rate_monitor

This project is part of the IoT course at HCMUT, designed to monitor heart rate data in real-time using IoT devices.

## Project Overview

The **Heart Rate Monitor** app is built with **Flutter** and integrates with IoT sensors to collect and display heart rate data. This application is aimed at providing users with the ability to monitor and analyze their heart rate remotely.

### Features:
- Real-time heart rate monitoring using IoT sensors.
- Visual representation of heart rate data in graphs.
- User-friendly interface with intuitive controls.
- Data storage and retrieval for historical analysis.

## Technologies Used:
- **Flutter** for mobile app development.
- **IoT sensors** (e.g., Pulse Oximeter or other sensors) for real-time data collection.
- **Firebase** or local storage for data persistence.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
- Flutter SDK (Install from [Flutter official site](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install))
- A real-time IoT heart rate sensor (optional for local testing).

### Setup Instructions:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iAstronaut/heart_rate_monitor.git
